# Snow-Shoveler-js
### Introduction

You have a snow shoveling business and decide to write a program to help you
build quotes for clients.

In order to test your new program, the first quote you build will be for your
neighbor. You charge clients by the cubic foot of snow. The driveway of your
neighbor's house is 8 feet wide and 20 feet long. The last snowstorm dropped 8
inches of snow in total.

Here is your initial pricing chart:

```no-highlight
0 - 49 cubic feet:  $20
50 - 149 cubic feet: $50
150 - 299 cubic feet: $100
300+ cubic feet: $150
```

### Problem Statement

Write a program that displays how many cubic feet of snow dropped in a driveway
and how much it will cost the clients for you to clear out the snow.
